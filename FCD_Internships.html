				The Computer Science Internship Program at Northeastern Illinois University has provided successful internships at over a hundred Illinois companies, government agencies, and organizations.  Many of our former interns still work for the companies or organizations which provided them with internships.

			<h2>Internships</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Can start any time of the year.</li>
				<li>Can be part-time or full-time.</li>
				<li>Many are paid but we welcome all internship opportunities</li>
				<li>The CS department actively solicits internships and acts as an interested and active third party</li>
				<li>Many students research and line up their own internships</li>
			</ul>
